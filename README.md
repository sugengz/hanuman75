Thanks to the QMK community, this project was heavily inspired by [Punk75](https://github.com/dsanchezseco/punk75), this keyboard has become my daily driver in pandemic era, but I need some Fs row occasionally... So I remake it with Fs row and options to put the encoder as well as adding RGB underglow.
